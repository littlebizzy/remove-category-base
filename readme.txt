Completely disables the category base from all URLs generated by WordPress so that there is no category slug displayed on archive permalinks, etc.

== Description ==

Completely disables the category base from all URLs generated by WordPress so that there is no category slug displayed on archive permalinks, etc.

* changes e.g. `/category/food` to simply `/food/`
* implements 301 redirects for proper SEO and usability
* does not affect "tags" base
* does not affect "parent" category base (e.g. `/animals/dogs/`)
* does not affect custom taxonomies

It uses a combination of techniques from both plugins suggested. Also fixes a behaviour that does not worked well in the previous plugins and now is flushing properly the rewrite rules when the plugin is deactivated, so no need to regenerate the permalinks manually.

Also implements the compatibility with the SitePress plugin (WPML) at the moment of retrieve the current categories, among other technical improvements.

The category overwritten rules cover the category permalink, the category pagination and the category feeds pages.

The old URLs started with /category/ (or the defined custom URL base prefix) will be redirected automatically to the new ones.
