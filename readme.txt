== Installation ==

1. Upload to `/wp-content/plugins/remove-category-base-littlebizzy`
2. Activate via WP Admin > Plugins
3. Test plugin is working:

After activating the plugin, purge all caches and then load one of the old category links that contains the `/category/` slug and it should be 301 redirected to a new "collapsed" URL that does not contain that slug.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change this plugin's settings? =

There is no settings page to maintain top performance and simplicity.

= Why is this plugin better than similar plugins? =

It uses a combination of techniques from other previous similar plugins. Also fixes a behaviour that does not worked well in the previous plugins and now is flushing properly the rewrite rules when the plugin is deactivated, so no need to regenerate the permalinks manually.

Also implements the compatibility with the SitePress plugin (WPML) at the moment of retrieve the current categories, among other technical improvements.
