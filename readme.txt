* [SlickStack (LEMP stack automation)](https://slickstack.io)
* [WP Lite boilerplate](https://wplite.org)
* [Starter Theme](https://starter.littlebizzy.com)

#### The Long Version ####

* changes e.g. `/category/food` to simply `/food/`
* implements 301 redirects for proper SEO and usability
* does not affect "tags" base
* does not affect "parent" category base (e.g. `/animals/dogs/`)
* does not affect custom taxonomies

It uses a combination of techniques from both plugins suggested. Also fixes a behaviour that does not worked well in the previous plugins and now is flushing properly the rewrite rules when the plugin is deactivated, so no need to regenerate the permalinks manually.

Also implements the compatibility with the SitePress plugin (WPML) at the moment of retrieve the current categories, among other technical improvements.

The category overwritten rules cover the category permalink, the category pagination and the category feeds pages.

The old URLs started with /category/ (or the defined custom URL base prefix) will be redirected automatically to the new ones.

#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on LEMP (Nginx) web servers with PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and security reasons, we highly recommend against using WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

#### Nag Notices ####

This plugin generates multiple [Admin Notices](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices) in the WP Admin dashboard. The first is a notice that fires during plugin activation which recommends several related free plugins that we believe will enhance this plugin's features; this notice will re-appear approximately once every 6 months as our code and recommendations evolve. The second is a notice that fires a few days after plugin activation which asks for a 5-star rating of this plugin on its WordPress.org profile page. This notice will re-appear approximately once every 9 months. These notices can be dismissed by clicking the **(x)** symbol in the upper right of the notice box. These notices may annoy or confuse certain users, but are appreciated by the majority of our userbase, who understand that these notices support our free contributions to the WordPress community while providing valuable (free) recommendations for optimizing their website.

If you feel that these notices are too annoying, than we encourage you to consider one or more of our upcoming premium plugins that combine several free plugin features into a single control panel, or even consider developing your own plugins for WordPress, if supporting free plugin authors is too frustrating for you. A final alternative would be to place the defined constant mentioned below inside of your `wp-config.php` file to manually hide this plugin's nag notices:

    define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);

Note: This defined constant will only affect the notices mentioned above, and will not affect any other notices generated by this plugin or other plugins, such as one-time notices that communicate with admin-level users.
